How to process the "Sign in" in Rails

1 Create a Session 
. generate a session controller 
. have three method in the session controller: create, new and destroy 
. under the new method, we create a page as log in page 
. verify the email and password in the create method, two steps: get user by email and check password by user.authenticate

2 Add a Cookie Store on Both Server Side and Browser Side 
. generate a cookie 
. save that cookie to the client's browser 
. save the cookie to the database which on the user's table, recommend to encrypt

. each time open a new page, all the variable will be cleared. So get the cookies from the client's browser when each time users open a new page
